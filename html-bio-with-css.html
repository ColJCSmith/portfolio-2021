      <p>Bluey is an Australian animated television series for preschool children that premiered on ABC Kids on 1 October 2018. The series was created by Joe Brumm with Queensland production group Ludo Studio. The series was co-commissioned by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation and the British Broadcasting Corporation, with BBC Studios holding global distribution and merchandising rights. The series made its premiere in the United States and the United Kingdom on Disney Junior and was released internationally on Disney+.  With the setting inspired by the city of Brisbane, the series follows an anthropomorphic six-year-old Blue Heeler puppy named Bluey, who is characterised by her abundance of energy, imagination and curiosity at the world. The young dog lives with her father, Bandit; mother, Chilli; and younger sister, Bingo, who regularly joins Bluey on adventures as the pair embark on imaginative play together. Overarching themes include the focus on family, growing up and Australian culture, with all of the characters representing a particular dog breed. The series was created and produced entirely in Australia, with investment from Screen Australia and Screen Queensland.</p>
